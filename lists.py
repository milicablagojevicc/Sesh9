#empty lists used to define the beginning point
#defined by [] and separated by commas ,
#unlike string, the list is mutable
#otherwise, many similarities with strings
#slicing is same as with strings
#positions are the same as well - starting with zero
#lists are like sets, can duplicate items in diff lists
